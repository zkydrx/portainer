      Business support is a subscription service and is delivered by Portainer developers directly. Portainer Business Support is available in Standard and Critical levels, which offer a range of availability and response time options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once acquired through an in-app purchase, a support subscription will enable private access to the Portainer Support Portal at the appropriate service level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business support includes comprehensive assistance and issue resolution for Portainer software, as well as the ability to ask “how to” questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issues outside Portainer (such as those relating to third party software or hardware) will be diagnosed, verified and the client will be referred to the relevant supplier for support. Portainer support will investigate and resolve any bugs that are identified as part of the support case.
